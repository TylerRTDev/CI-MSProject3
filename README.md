### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a multilingual vocabulary tracker called **LingoLink**, designed to help users build and manage their vocabulary across multiple languages. The app provides a smooth user interface for adding, editing, and deleting vocabulary entries, each with support for translations, pronunciation, and categorisation. It is built mobile-first to ensure usability on all screen sizes, and integrates with a backend database to persist user data.

### Target Audience

- Language learners at any stage — beginners to advanced
- Multilingual individuals managing vocabularies across several languages
- Students studying languages in school or university
- Anyone wanting to track vocabulary consistently and efficiently

### User Goals

- Add new words with translations and optional pronunciation or category
- View all added words in an organized card format
- Edit existing entries quickly using a clean modal interface
- Delete entries they no longer want
- Use the app seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices

### Color Scheme

The color scheme is inspired by the Lithuanian flag, consisting of:

- **Yellow** (`#fdd835`) – Used for primary buttons and highlights
- **Green** (`#388e3c`) – Used in headers and UI accents
- **Red** (`#d32f2f`) – Used for alerts, delete buttons, and emphasis
- **White** (`#ffffff`) – Used for background panels and forms
- **Dark Grey** (`#212121`) – Used for body text and header contrast
- **Light Grey** (`#f5f5f5`) – Used for background and section separation

This palette was chosen for its brightness, contrast, and accessibility.

### Typography

The primary font used is:

- **Segoe UI**, with fallbacks: `Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif`

This typeface was selected for its clean readability, strong support across browsers, and familiarity in modern UIs.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created to plan the mobile-first layout and user interaction flow.

- Mobile wireframes focus on a vertical stacking structure, prioritising form inputs and large tap targets.
- Desktop layouts make use of central alignment and spacing for easy readability.

_ Wireframe screenshots will be added here in the final version._
