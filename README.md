## ðŸ§  User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a multilingual vocabulary tracker called **LingoLink**, designed to help users build and manage their vocabulary across multiple languages. The app provides a smooth user interface for adding, editing, and deleting vocabulary entries, each with support for translations, pronunciation, and categorisation. It is built mobile-first to ensure usability on all screen sizes, and integrates with a backend database to persist user data.

### Target Audience

- Language learners at any stage â€” beginners to advanced
- Multilingual individuals managing vocabularies across several languages
- Students studying languages in school or university
- Anyone wanting to track vocabulary consistently and efficiently

### User Goals

- Add new words with translations and optional pronunciation or category
- View all added words in an organized card format
- Edit existing entries quickly using a clean modal interface
- Delete entries they no longer want
- Use the app seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices

### Color Scheme

The color scheme is inspired by the Lithuanian flag, consisting of:

- **Yellow** (`#fdd835`) â€“ Used for primary buttons and highlights
- **Green** (`#388e3c`) â€“ Used in headers and UI accents
- **Red** (`#d32f2f`) â€“ Used for alerts, delete buttons, and emphasis
- **White** (`#ffffff`) â€“ Used for background panels and forms
- **Dark Grey** (`#212121`) â€“ Used for body text and header contrast
- **Light Grey** (`#f5f5f5`) â€“ Used for background and section separation

This palette was chosen for its brightness, contrast, and accessibility.

### Typography

The primary font used is:

- **Segoe UI**, with fallbacks: `Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif`

This typeface was selected for its clean readability, strong support across browsers, and familiarity in modern UIs.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created to plan the mobile-first layout and user interaction flow.

- Mobile wireframes focus on a vertical stacking structure, prioritising form inputs and large tap targets.
- Desktop layouts make use of central alignment and spacing for easy readability.

_ Wireframe screenshots will be added here in the final version._

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

### Languages Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Python (Flask backend)
- MongoDB
- Render (Cloud Deployment)

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) â€“ Python web framework for API and backend logic
- [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/) â€“ Interact with MongoDB Atlas
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) â€“ Cloud-hosted NoSQL database
- [Render](https://render.com) â€“ Deployed Flask backend
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) â€“ Deployed frontend
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) â€“ Manual API testing
- [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) â€“ Manage environment variables

### Data Model

Each word in the MongoDB collection follows this structure:

```json
{
  "word": "Hello",
  "language": "English",
  "pronunciation": "heh-lo",
  "category": "Greeting",
  "translations": {
    "Lithuanian": "Labas",
    "French": "Bonjour"
  }
}
```

- All fields are optional except the `word` and at least one `translation`.
- `translations` is a key-value object where each key is a language name and the value is its corresponding translation.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This project is deployed using two services:

### ðŸ”§ Backend (Flask API)
- Hosted on: [Render](https://render.com)
- Repository includes `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, and `.env` (not tracked).
- Environment Variables:
  - `MONGO_URI` â€” Secure database connection string
  - `DB_NAME` â€” MongoDB database name

### ðŸŽ¨ Frontend (Static Hosting)
- Hosted on: [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/TylerRTDev/CI-MSProject3)
- `scripts.js` connects to the deployed Flask API using the `API_BASE` constant
- No build tool required â€” app loads directly from `index.html`
